            <h3>Plate of Joy</h3>
            <p>no one should have to sleep hungry. Over the last 15 years, we have delivered more than 1,00,00,000 meals to those in need, in partnership with authorities across the country with over 20+ feeding programs. In the midst of the on-going pandemic,
                social distancing is a luxury that India’s informal workforce of 450 million cannot afford. With the government lockdown order and inadequate state provisions for food distribution, several families are sleeping hungry -- in their homes,
                stranded at railway stations or state borders. We provide food support to families of daily wage earners across cities, who might have lost out on employment in this time of crisis. With the aim to raise INR 50 crore, the project is slowly
                inching towards the halfway mark, by having amassed more than INR 17 crore in donation. Each meal kit, procured with the funds and costing INR 500, should last a family of five for a week and contains a combination of basic staples such
                as wheat flour, rice and two kinds of pulses. The non-profit has partnered with other NGOs and social enterprises working on the ground such as the Centre for Education and Health Research Organisation in Delhi and Balancing Bits in Gurugram,
                while following proper social distancing guidelines.</p>

            <h3>GreenSnaan</h3>
            <p>The ultimate goal of the REACH is providing safe, healthy, drinking water and adequate sanitation in areas where it is not available or where accessibility and supply have been compromised. They do this with a charitable trust. It connects
                organizations to tackle the world’s most pressing challenge of access to clean water. Among their many connections are Sustainable WASH that has been successful in reversing the inevitable failure of 30% of the projects. They serve rural
                and underserved communities with high incidences of waterborne diseases and limited resources. WASH in the schools is one of their focal points. They have revived BioSand filters in these communities and provided education about water
                safety, hygiene and proper sanitation to school children − the joy, the hope, the future. We provide access to clean water, education about separating human waste from contact with its people, and basic hygiene like simple washing with
                soap. It provides sanitation education in schools and sends teams to handle emergencies</p>

            <h3>UPLIFT</h3>
            <p>With the motto BE AMONG THEM the organization has addressed several issues such as learning levels, dropout rates, child rights, and teacher training. Their programs focus on education, vocational training, technology, vulnerable children,
                and research and advocacy. Notably, it’s research and assessment unit publishes the Annual Status of Education Report (ASER), which is the only annual source of data on children’s learning outcome in the country today.This aims to redeﬁne
                what is possible for children from low-income communities to achieve through its network of high-performing public-private partnership schools.Parents actively engage in the process of their child’s development through programs such as
                the School Management Committee, parent literacy classes, parent volunteerism and community-wide efforts to address key issues such as women’s empowerment, substance abuse, physical violence and others.Working directly with children and
                youth as well as through large-scale collaborations with government systems. Across the spectrum from Early Childhood Education to Secondary Education, our programs strive to achieve focused objectives across different segments, as defined
                by our understanding of existing gaps and the impact of our innovations over time.Educate Girls currently operates successfully in over 18,000+ villages in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh. By leveraging the Government’s existing
                investment in schools and by engaging with a huge base of community volunteers, Educate Girls helps to identify, enrol and retain out-of-school girls and to improve foundational skills in literacy and numeracy for all children (both girls
                and boys). This helps deliver measurable results to a large number of children and avoids parallel delivery of services.</p>

            <h3>AAROGYA</h3>
            <p>According to the UNICEF report, India reported deaths of 8,82,000 children below five years in 2018. It highlights that every second child below the age of five in the country is affected by some form of malnutrition. Millions of children
                in India die of treatable conditions every year. The lack of access to healthcare and expensive treatments, force these children to suffer silently with diseases that could easily be treated. According to a report by the UN’s Inter-agency
                Group for Child Mortality Estimation (UNIGME), 802,000 infants died in India in the year 2017 due to the lack of access to proper healthcare, sanitation, nutrition, and water. Even though these numbers are the lowest in 5 years, India
                still has the highest infant mortality rate in the world with almost 4 lakh more deaths than Nigeria who came in second. As per the 2019 government data, India has reduced its infant mortality rate (IMR) by 42% over 11 years-from 57 per
                1,000 live births in 2006 to 33 in 2017. This is a first for a large country like India, and active efforts by both the government and nonprofits, that have worked to bring the positive change. Their combined efforts work to not only save
                children in need but also provide medical aid to expecting mothers.Around one per hundred organizations primarily or subsidiarily involved in health activities has a hospital. The corresponding figures for outpatient clinics are around
                9% and health system supportive services are about 11%. An overwhelming number of NGOs, about 84%, are found in outreach activities. The outreach activity is the main health activity for more than 60% of NGOs functioning primarily in health
                sector. The outreach activities is the main health activity of about 88% of subsidiary health-NGOs in India. Generating awareness to targeted population is the major sub-component of outreach for Indian NGOs. Around 68 out of 100 NGOs
                have reported health awareness as their outreach activity. The health sector functioning of NGOs is not a mutually exclusive set of activities; an organization may play roles in several health activities simultaneously.In India, NGO-run
                hospitals are heterogeneous and vary in terms of ownership, financing and costs. In recent past, in about ten health-oriented projects of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, NGOs have actively taken part as
                health service providers to the financing agent (fund management) based on their level of capacity (for instance, Mother-NGO Scheme). All those NGO-schemes are now under the provision of flexi-pools in National Health Mission (NHM). Besides,
                some NGOs (especially the national counterparts of international NGOs and faith-based organizations) might have their own health financing schemes. Those that are present in rural areas and part of development programs, function for the
                community by providing primary and secondary services. For example, SEWA-Rural in Gujarat, was assigned the responsibility of providing community-based health services in a district covering 40 villages with a population size 35,000. In
                the mid-eighties, the State Government of Gujarat turned over the services of ten health sub-centers to this NGO with a block grant (Dave 1990). Berman and Dave (1994) reviewed that despite substantial government grant, VHS hospital in
                Tamil Nadu collected 57 percent of revenue from patients as user fees. Nundy (2005) pointed out that the out-of- pocket payment by patients is a common source for taking care of recurrent costs in NGO-run hospitals in India. Most primary
                health centers and dispensaries run by the non-governmental sector, however, charge a nominal fee from the users. NGO-run secondary and tertiary-level hospitals charge fee for service from those who can afford in order to cross-subsidize;
                but those in urban areas are sometimes inaccessible to many. Alongside health care facilities, NGOs are also involved in several preventive care activities, perhaps more than curative care. As a case study, Nanjunda and Dinesha (2011)
                showed how several NGOs are involved in creating health awareness among tribals through various community-based approaches including door-to-door information flow, street plays, visuals and debates in tribal panchayats. Indeed, the nature
                and focus of individual NGOs vary extensively, and it becomes difficult to make generalization about the sector as a whole. A further level of complexity arises for the existence of non-governmental sector because of several legal provisions
                in India.</p>
